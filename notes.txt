TO DO

convert tsv to csv

Implement these algorithms
- FastPG
- Scanpy (run dos2unix on input file?)
- flowSOM (you know, I'm not that it makes sense to use this algorithm)

I may need to build a docker container that can handle all these

What kind of results do I want?
- a tsv with the drug name in one column and cluster assignment in the other
